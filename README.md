# Guidelime_ClassicWoWdotLive
A tool to generate a set of [Guidelime](https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime) guides to streamline leveling in WoW Classic.

## Source of the guides
I do not own or represent any rights whatsoever on the guide(s) itself. This tool does not ship any content from [ClassicWOW.live](https://classicwow.live/leveling). It can be used however to download and parse content originating from [ClassicWOW.live](https://classicwow.live/leveling), allowing users to generate A WoW Classic 1.13 Addon code base.

## Previous work
A similar, earlier project exists in https://github.com/lukeknoot/classicwow-to-guidelime, which I did not know before hacking my version.

## Dependencies
[Guidelime](https://github.com/max-ri/Guidelime)
